This is a Next.js project featuring an infinite scroll image gallery built with the Unsplash API. The gallery dynamically fetches and displays images in a Masonry layout, loading new images as the user scrolls down. Clicking on an image opens it in a centered popup, showcasing additional details.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/aayush1303/Pixorama.git
cd Pixorama
npm install

Second, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `components/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
